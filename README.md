Consider a computer system consisting of m processors and with a total capacity of K jobs (including those jobs being served by the processors). Assume K  m. Administrative job tasks arrive to the system according to a Poisson process with rate 1 jobs/second. If the system is at its full capacity of K jobs, arriving administrative job tasks are blocked from entering the system. User job tasks arrive to the system according to a Poisson process with rate 2 jobs/second. In order to maintain space in the system for future administrative job tasks, a threshold limit of l is set for user job tasks. If the total number of jobs in the system is greater than or equal to l, then arriving user job tasks will be blocked from entering the system. Assume that 0  l  K. Once jobs enter the system, they are all treated equally, and each job requires a processing time that is exponentially distributed with an average processing time of 1 Î¼ seconds.
